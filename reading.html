			I find a great number of things interesting and thus, enjoy reading books that talk about my interests.That said, my favourite thing to read is manga. Mangas are basically japanese comic books. They imbibe everything that makes a book awesome including drama, comedy, action, adventure, suspense and intrigue. A single manga may even have all of these qualities.

		<p>My favorite manga is One Piece.</p>
